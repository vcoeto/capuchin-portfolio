{# ``base.html`` is the template all our other templates derive from. While
Flask-Bootstrap ships with its own base, it is good form to create a custom one
for our app, as it allows customizing some aspects. Deriving from
bootstap/base.html gives us a basic page scaffoling. You can find additional
information about template inheritance at
http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#template-inheritance #} {%- extends
"bootstrap/base.html" %} {# We also set a default title, usually because we
might forget to set one.#} {% block title %} capuchin-portfolio {% endblock %}
{# While we are at it, we also enable fixes for legacy browsers. First we import
the necessary macros: #} {% import "bootstrap/fixes.html" as fixes %} {# Then,
inside the head block, we apply these. To not replace the header, ``super()`` is
used: #} {% block head %} {{super()}} {{fixes.ie8()}} {%- endblock %} {# Adding
our own CSS files is also done here. Check the documentation at
http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/basic-usage.html#available-blocks for an
overview. #} {% block styles %} {{super()}}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./static/styles/main.css" type="text/css" />

<link rel="icon" href="./static/img/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />

{% endblock %} {# Finally, round things out with navigation #} {% block navbar
%} {{nav.mynavbar.render()}} {% endblock %}
